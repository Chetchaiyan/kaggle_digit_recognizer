# Tensorflow Python for digit recognition
Simple and easy to understand (hopefully) deep learning by using Tensorflow in Python. 

The code is used to solve the competition problem from Kaggle name [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

The code will seperated in 3 files
 - **verify_dataset.ipynb** (not finish yet) This files intent to verify dataset to make sure that we understand dataset we have.
 - **multilayer_perceptron.ipynb** This files show you how to solve the problem by using MLP(Multilayer Perceptron) which is simple enough to understand the basic concept of Deep Learning and try to understand code.
 - **convolution.ipynb** This files show you how to solve the problem by using CNN(convolution neural network) which is the suitable solution for image classification problem. 

I hope this code would be useful for you. Any advises are welcome so please email to me.
